What is emergence (multiple things)

How would we see it manifest?

(Squiggles surpassing memory limits)

How does that work for pitch

Self-organization vs emergence (Where is the boundary?)

Leitmotifs

Semiology

Psychoacoustics

Multiple examples

Each pitch is its own agent, need to negotiate to be included

Real time negotiation between agents

Constrain the agents

Constraints-based approach

Leitmotif evolutionary algorithms



Each motif bargaining for time
Nodes in graph
Who can bargain who

Each pitch is an agent
preferred trading partners?


Evolutionary counterpoint
Evaluate counterpoints in accordance to the rules mentioned in Fux
Think about crossing algorithm, position is important, but also adjacency?


Try and affect velocity in some ways? Could be interesting?

Emergence in music, not boids pls

Arpeggios?

Give the agents limited resources

Remove constraints to get chaos (which is good)

Melodies is already kinda emergence?

Novelty through complexity



Constraints probably either time or pitch

Orchestra


Start from the beginning and end

Hamming distance for pitch - Compare histograms of note distributions

Some kinda gamma distribution esque value function

Solojam just disallowed small hamming distances

Start making a quartet simulation!



Energy simulation

Possibly allow changing every note

Instead of histogram do the way the note changes?

Dovetailing

More advanced keep track of note order



Hardware have multiple belas interact

Go full art installation

Todd Ingels

Make a histogram of notes played to determine "scale"



Plots!

Energy and utility!

Find out why the agents converge, and learn to control it.

Make a github!

Agents bargaining for notes they want to play.

Their allowance is their histograms.

How to make agents want to play certain notes?

Consider machine learning
