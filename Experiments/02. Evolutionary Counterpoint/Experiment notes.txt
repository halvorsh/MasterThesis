In an attempt to produce new melodies, I decided to try and apply evolutionary algorithms to generate motifs.

The scoring is done according to the rules of counterpoint (See Fux' book)

The capabilities of the system allows for counterpoint with multiple voices, creating 3 and 4 voice counterpoint as well, by using the generated counterpoint as the new baseline.
